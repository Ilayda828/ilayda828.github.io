This repository serves as the codebase for my personal portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 🎯 Purpose
The main goal of this project is to create a centralized, accessible digital showcase for my journey as a **Computer Engineering student**. It aims to demonstrate my technical abilities beyond a standard CV by detailing:
* My professional internship experiences (e.g., Digital Garden Technology).
* Complex academic projects (RAG AI, Database Systems, Operating Systems).
* My evolving technical skill set.

## 🔄 A Living Project
This portfolio is **not a static document**. It is designed to grow alongside my career. I will be regularly updating this repository to include:
* New projects from my upcoming academic terms.
* Future software development experiments and side projects.
* New technologies and certifications I acquire.
